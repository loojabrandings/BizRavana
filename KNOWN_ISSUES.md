# Bizravana — Known Issues

> Last reviewed: 2026-07-26

This file tracks current limitations and technical debt.

## Current issues

- Database migration state must be verified independently in each deployed Supabase environment (36 migrations).
- **3 orphaned Supabase tables** exist with no migration coverage — `courier_cities`, `courier_districts`, `courier_waybills`. They default to `koombiyo_delivery` provider and are not referenced by any application code.
- Account provisioning is idempotent but client-driven. A database function should eventually make business/profile creation fully transactional.
- There is no automated test suite yet; lint and production builds are the current verification gates.
- **Read Only Mode** is enforced client-side via a React provider. Server-side enforcement (middleware or RLS) would be a more robust approach for locking down expired accounts.
- Soft-deleted records are hidden from the UI but not yet purged after the retention period.
- Scheduled retention-expiry auto-purge is not configured. Super Admin permanent deletion itself is implemented with Storage, schema-aware database, and Auth cleanup.
- **Dialog blur applies to main content area only on pages wrapped in DashboardLayout** — non-dashboard pages (auth, standalone) won't get the blur effect when a dialog opens since they lack the `[data-main-content]` target.
- **Toast per-type auto-dismiss durations** not configurable globally — default is 5000ms for all types. Success/info/warning/error/loading all share the same duration.
- **Trial auto-expiry cron** (migration 020) requires `pg_cron` to be available on the Supabase project. If not available, trials must be expired manually via SQL.
- **Automated notification cron** (migration 025) uses `pg_cron` which doesn't run in local Supabase (`supabase start`). Notifications must be triggered manually via the Admin Notifications page "Send Now" button during local development.
- **Notifications are in-app only** — No email or push notification delivery channel implemented yet.
- **No subscription to notification_recipients table** — The Realtime subscription is on `notifications` (business-scoped), but `notification_recipients` changes don't trigger UI updates. The read_at field is updated optimistically from the client.
- **Notification bell does not poll as fallback** — For environments where WebSocket connections are blocked or unstable, the bell relies solely on the focus event refetch. A polling fallback could improve reliability.
- **Smart Parser district matching limited** — The `normalizeForMatch()` only handles `th→t`, `dh→d`, `sh→s` transliterations. Other common spelling variations (e.g., "Moneragala" vs "Monaragala") are not handled.
- **Smart Parser depends on courier city data** — Reverse city lookup only works when the business has courier configured and city data synced. Without courier data, only district matching works; city must be entered manually.
- **Smart Parser does not persist parsed data** — The parsed output is directly applied to the form fields with no undo. The Reset button provides a way to clear all fields, but there's no "undo last parse" feature.
- **Clipboard API requires HTTPS/localhost** — The "Paste from clipboard" button uses `navigator.clipboard.readText()` which requires a secure context (HTTPS) or localhost. In production HTTP environments, users must paste manually.

## MVP limitations

- PayHere checkout is sandbox-ready; live use is pending merchant verification and live configuration.
- No WhatsApp Business API integration (uses simple `wa.me` links).
- No email, PWA, or offline mode yet.
- Only Royal Express integrated. The provider architecture now makes adding new couriers a ~100-line single-file task (implement `CourierProvider` + register).
- No image upload for products yet (avatars/logos, order images, and payment proofs are implemented).
- The delivery module has settings in the Settings page but no dedicated delivery management page.
- Reports are limited to 500 records per query (optimization needed for larger datasets).
- The "Preferences" page is at a separate sub-route (`/dashboard/settings/preferences`) which may confuse users navigating from the main settings page.

## Resolved

- Manual-payment-only limitation: PayHere checkout, reconciliation, idempotent activation, history, and admin visibility are implemented.
- Unsafe/incomplete admin deletion: permanent deletion now performs Storage cleanup, schema-aware database purge, Auth deletion, and detailed activity logging.
- Users can submit bug reports with screenshots, view full report history/status, and receive admin responses.
- Super Admin can create targeted, scheduled dashboard ads with live preview, Fit/Fill artwork, and seven-day dismiss.

- Order numbering no longer skips numbers or changes when an order is updated.
- Forgot password flow now lands on the password reset page instead of logging in directly.
- Auth callback PKCE code verifier error resolved.
- Image upload for orders now works with Supabase Storage per-item mapping.
- Backup import no longer fails on generated columns, schema drift, or primary key conflicts.
- Dashboard and auth callback routes now match the URLs used by navigation.
- Email-confirmed users now finish business/profile provisioning on callback.
- Next.js middleware was migrated to the Next.js 16 proxy convention.
- Dashboard revenue now aggregates all matching orders instead of only the five displayed orders.
- Orders, products, inventory, expenses, customers, quotations, delivery, reports, notifications, subscription, and settings routes are now implemented.
- Storage RLS now supports both avatar and logo upload paths.
- Soft delete works via SECURITY DEFINER RPC functions.
- **Temporal Dead Zone bug**: Fixed across all 5 table pages.
- **Admin placeholder pages**: Activity Log, Settings, Cleanup Queue are now fully built.
- **400 Bad Request on profiles query**: Removed invalid `email` column selection from profiles table across 5 admin pages. Emails now fetched from `auth.users` via secure API.
- **Admin panel mobile responsiveness**: All 11 admin pages now use responsive card-based layouts on mobile.
- **Notifications not delivered**: "Send Now" broadcasts now actually insert notification records via server-side API route.
- **Realtime notification bell**: Upgraded from polling placeholder to shared NotificationProvider with WebSocket subscription.
- **Royal Express waybill**: Now uses the order's pre-assigned `waybill_id` instead of generating synthetic `"CM" + order_number` waybills. Auto waybill flow (omits `waybill_number` to let Royal Express generate one) also fixed.
- **Shipping Label Feature**: Completely removed — deleted 6 files, cleaned up 3 integration points, removed `jsbarcode` and `svg2pdf.js` dependencies. No other features affected.
